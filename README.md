Demo search UI and REST adapter for dense, sparse, and hybrid search over content indexed by [`wpvdb`](https://github.com/rbcorrales/wpvdb).

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version or notes |
|---|---|
| WordPress | 6.9 or newer |
| PHP | 8.3 or newer |
| [`wpvdb-search`](https://github.com/rbcorrales/wpvdb-search) | Installed and configured |

## What this plugin owns

- The `/smart-search/` public page.
- The `wpvdb-smart-search/v1` REST namespace.
- The React UI, browser assets, and REST adapter.
- Demo examples, placeholders, and UI copy.
- A WP-CLI prewarm command for example query embeddings.

Search execution lives in [`wpvdb-search`](https://github.com/rbcorrales/wpvdb-search).

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
composer install
```

Build the browser assets:

```bash
bun run build
```

Run the local checks:

```bash
bun run lint
```

The main branch maintenance workflow regenerates translation files and commits them when strings change.

Run the same command locally only when you want to preview language file changes:

```bash
bun run i18n
```
